NAME

    RTF::Group - Base class for manipulating Rich Text Format (RTF)
    groups

DESCRIPTION

    This is a base class for manipulating RTF groups. Groups are
    stored internally as lists. Lists may contain (sub)groups or
    atoms (raw text or control words).

    Unlike the behavior of groups in the original RTF::Document
    module (versions 0.63 and earlier), references to arrays (lists)
    are *not* treated as subgroups, but are dereferenced when
    expanded (as lists or strings).

    This allows more flexibility for changing control codes within a
    group, without having to know their exact location, or to use
    kluges like *splice* on the arrays.

METHODS

  new

        $group = new RTF::Group LIST;

    Creates a new group. If LIST is specified, it is appended to the
    group.

  append

        $group->append LIST;

    Appends LIST to the group. LIST may be plain text, controls,
    other groups, or references to a SCALAR or another LIST.

  list

        @RTF = $group->list();

    Returns the group as a list (array). Subgroups are lists within
    the list. This is useful for parsers.

  string

        print $group->string();

    Returns the group as a string that would appear in an RTF
    document.

  is_empty

        if ($group->is_empty) { ... }

    Returns true if the group is empty, false if it contains
    something. Zero-length strings are considered nothing.
